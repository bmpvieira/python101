# Variables
> a variable is a storage location and an associated symbolic name

# Integers
```python
a = 1
b = 2
print a + b
```

# Strings
```python
a = "hello"
b = "world"
print a + b
```
# Integers + Strings
```python
a = 1
b = "world"
print a + b
```

# Lists
```python
a = [1,2,3,4,5]
b = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "f"]
```

# Tuples

# Dictionaries

# Code to break
```python
a = 0
if a <= 0:
	print "ola"
else:
	print "adeus"
```

# Sets

# What is python?

Python is an **interpreted**, **object-oriented**, **high-level** programming language, that emphasizes in code readability:

- **Interpreted**: Programs can be run as soon as they are written, no need to compile;
- **Object-oriented**: The programming paradigm, where "objects" can be somewhat separated from the rest of the program. An object is an entity that has a: 
	- **Identity**: Unique identifier of the object
	- **Value**: 
	- **Type**: whether it is a string, number, etc. 
- **High-level**: Abstracts from the computer it is being run on;

# Two ways of running python code

## The interactive mode

- Ideal for **training** and **testing blocks of code** on the fly. During an interactive session, instructions are directly executed. However, the code cannot be saved between different sessions. Some interactive interpreters include:
	- [Python's built-in interpreter](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/interpreter.html)
	- [Python IDLE](http://docs.python.org/library/idle.html)
	- [Dreampie](http://dreampie.sourceforge.net/)

## Script mode

- Used to construct most Python programs following this simple procedure:
	- Create and edit a text file with Python code using a text editor ([geany](http://www.geany.org/), [vim](http://www.vim.org/)).
	- Save the file with the filename extension ".py"
	- Run the script with the Python interpreter

# The interactive mode

In its easiest form, the iteractive mode can be initialized by simply typing "**python**" in the command line prompt.

- The symbols "**>>>**" are the prompt of the interactive mode. To execute an instruction, write on the prompt line and press enter.
- The symbols "**...**" are the secondary prompt. They represent continuation lines, i.e., when the instruction is not yet complete and ready to be executed.
- To exit the interactive mode, you can use the keywords "**Ctrl + D**" or type "**quit()**"

# The script mode

Writing scripts will make the majority of your coding experience. A python script that contains a set of instructions can be executed in more than one way:

- **Script argument way**:
	- Run your python interpreter in the prompt with the script as an argument (e.g. python my_script.py). This mode is prefered for scripts that require arguments to be passed when executed

- **Double clicking**:
	- Run your script simply by double-cliking it. However, this mode will only be useful when the user input is collected using the prompt feature of the **input()** and **raw_input** functions, that will be covered in the 4th Day

# Online resources

Some of the most usefull resources that will help you solving problems and getting new ideas during your coding sessions:

- [Official Python tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/): From the official Python documentation, this resource covers all basic and advance built-in features of Python.
- [Python wiki](http://wiki.python.org/moin/): Includes several oficial Python resources, such as the [begginers guide](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide), [begginers erros](http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnerErrorsWithPythonProgramming) and [Python books](http://wiki.python.org/moin/PythonBooks). 
- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/): An extremely usefull language-independent collaboratively edited question and answer site for programmers. Most of the questions and problems that you may face when coding have been probably already answered in this forum.

## [Google](google.com) is your friend

- Giving the current flood of digital data, the importance of google's search engine to sort over all information cannot be overstated. The trick, however, is knowing how to put your problem in order to obtain the most usefull answers.
